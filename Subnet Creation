1. Subnet Creation
Goal: Create a private /24 subnet in the default VPC.
Steps:
Go to VPC Dashboard in the AWS Console.
Click Subnets > Create subnet.
Choose:
VPC: Select your default VPC.
Subnet name: Private-Subnet-Dunni
Availability Zone:  us-east-1a
IPv4 CIDR block: Use a /24 block  10.0.2.0/24
Click Create subnet.


2. Security Hardening
Goal: Create and configure a security group for web servers.
Steps:
Go to EC2 Dashboard > Security Groups > Create security group.
Name: Web-Tier-SG
Description: "Allow HTTP from anywhere, SSH from My IP"
VPC: Select the default VPC
Inbound rules:
HTTP | TCP | Port 80 | Source: 0.0.0.0/0
SSH | TCP | Port 22 | Source: My IP 102.88.110.250/32
Click Create security group


3. Resource Association
Goal: Move Wednesday's EC2 instance to new subnet and apply new security group.
Steps:
Note: You cannot directly move a running instance to a new subnet. You'll need to stop the instance, create an AMI, and launch a new one in the new subnet.
Identify Wednesday's EC2 instance -My-instance
Stop the instance.
Click Actions > Create Image (AMI)
After AMI is ready:
Go to AMIs, select the AMI
Click Launch instance
Choose:
Subnet: MY-DEFAULT-VPC-SUBNET
Security Group: Web-Tier-SG



5. Launch the instance.

4. Connectivity Verification
a) Check HTTP (Apache) access:
Get the Public IP of the new EC2 instance.
Open browser and go to: http://3.91.155.158/


 the Apache test page will appear


b) Test SSH restriction:
Try SSH from an unauthorized IP (MyIP).
Firstly, i had to change my inbound rules to shh into My-IP-102.88.110.250/32 
This means:
Only My IP can SSH in.
No one else can connect via SSH including myself
   If You See: Permission denied (publickey)
That means:
You reached the server over SSH so the IP restriction is working 
You should not get access.
